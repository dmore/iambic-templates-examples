# iambic-templates-examples

This is an example IAMbic templates repository. When you use [IAMbic](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic) to track your multi-cloud IAM assets, you can store the assets into a repository like this one. This repository is public for documentation purposes. You will not have to make your IAMbic templates repository public, espeically if you are worry about PII (personal identitifable information due to email or username). 

# Directory Layout

IAMbic has a convention to import assets into `resources/<plugin-name>/<resource-type>` convention. However, you can re-arrange the directory layout to fit your needs. IAMbic will transverse the whole templates repository when it accounts for cloud assets.
